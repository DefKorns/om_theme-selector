### Can i use it with NAND
Well, yes. But this mod was designed for USB-HOST, as the themes may include audio files and they may get over 10Mb.

### Set theme per folder, what is that?
If you are like me and have tons of games organized with tons of system folders... Wouldn't be nice if you could have a theme associated with each system? Now you can, just create your own theme and add it to the HMOD or directly to your USB/SD theme folder.
On this version all subfolders, will keep the parent theme.

### Ok and how will the system load the theme?
Just give it the same name as your folder (lower snake_case). Eg: game folder: `Nintendo - Nintendo Entertainment System` theme folder: `nintendo_-_nintendo_entertainment_system`.

### What if i want a specific theme on my main menu?
Add a theme as before but name it `default` in order to make it you home menu theme. 
That simple.

### I own a Famicom/Shonen/Super Famicom, can i install this?
The mod is compatible with all Nintendo Classic consoles including all regions.

### What do you mean with "Create a theme based your existent theme resources"?
Exactly that! If you have several themes on your console/usb, why not take advantage of their resources and create your own DIY theme? 
Simply select from the listed previews and create your own DIY theme.

### Requirements
*  [Hakchi CE v3.5.0 >=](https://github.com/TeamShinkansen/hakchi2/releases/latest)
*  [Options Menu v.1.3.4 >=](https://github.com/CompCom/OptionsMenu/releases/latest)
*  [Hakchi Wi-Fi mod (WPA Supplicant)](https://hakchi.net/hakchi/hmods/wpa-supplicant.hmod)

### How do i use it

**NAND or USB/SD**

- Install Hmod
- Download the themes and enjoy

on NAND themes will be on `/var/lib/hakchi/usr/share/themes/consoletype`
on USB/SD themes will be on `/media/hakchi/themes/consoletype`

*consoletype is just `nes`, `snes`  or `shonen`*

### Notes
