# Theme Randomizer
**This modification is only for use with [CompCom's](https://github.com/CompCom) Options Menu.**
### Version: v1.0.10

## HMOD NOT COMPATIBLE WITH EXTERNAL UI NOR ADVANCED MUSIC HACK

### What is it?
This Hakchi2 module (HMOD) adds the ability to switch themes randomly and OnTheFly, simply by changing folders or the most wonderful thing.... simply by custom folder. Now you can have your specific theme too!

### What do you mean?
*Here's an example* 

`Click the image below to view it on YouTube.`

[![Theme Randomizer - Demo](https://imghost.io/images/2018/10/09/20181009_002350_0000.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5gK7_0wfi0 "Theme Randomizer - Demo")

### How do i use it
*First of all you'll need themes, and they must follow the structure of the default ui, i'll provide 3 themes as example* 

**NAND**

- Add your themes to `/var/lib/hakchi/usr/share/themes/consoletype`.
- Install Hmod


**USB/SD**

- Install Hmod
- Add your themes folders to `MEDIA:\hakchi\themes\consoletype`.

*consoletype is just `nes`, `snes`  or `shonen`*

### Specific Themes, what is that?
If you are like me and have tons of games organized with tons of system folders... Wouldn't be nice if you could have a theme associated with each system? Now you can, just create your own theme and add it to the HMOD or directly to your USB/SD theme folder.

### Ok and how will the system load the theme?
Just give it the same name as your folder (lower snake_case). Eg: game folder: `Nintendo - Nintendo Entertainment System` theme folder: `nintendo_-_nintendo_entertainment_system`.

### What if i want a specific theme on my main menu?
Add a theme as before but name it `default` in order to make it you home menu theme. 
That simple.

### Notes

**MAX 60 Themes** more will lead to booting issues + **C8**
Not compatible with custom on theme custom fonts, if you want to use custom fonts use DTM hmod. 

Enjoy it as much as i did making it.
