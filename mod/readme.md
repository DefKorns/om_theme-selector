# Options Menu - Theme Selector
**This modification is only for use with [CompCom's](https://github.com/CompCom) Options Menu.**
## HMOD NOT COMPATIBLE WITH EXTERNAL UI. PREVIOUS VERSIONS OF THEME RANDOMIZER AND ADVANCED MUSIC HACK WILL BE UNINSTALLED.

### What is it?
This [Options Menu](https://github.com/CompCom/OptionsMenu/releases/latest) module gives you the possibility to choose your favorite theme to apply it on your NESCE or SNESCE. 
As it's (Theme RandomizR) it also allows you to the enable the random theme option, and system folders for a better customization of your console. 

### How do i use it

**NAND**

- Add your themes to `/var/lib/hakchi/usr/share/themes/consoletype`.
- Install Hmod


**USB/SD**

- Install Hmod
- Add your themes folders to `MEDIA:\hakchi\themes\consoletype`.

*consoletype is just `nes`, `snes`  or `shonen`*

### Specific Themes, what is that?
If you are like me and have tons of games organized with tons of system folders... Wouldn't be nice if you could have a theme associated with each system? Now you can, just create your own theme and add it to the HMOD or directly to your USB/SD theme folder.

### Ok and how will the system load the theme?
Just give it the same name as your folder (lower snake_case). Eg: game folder: `Nintendo - Nintendo Entertainment System` theme folder: `nintendo_-_nintendo_entertainment_system`.

### What if i want a specific theme on my main menu?
Add a theme as before but name it `default` in order to make it you home menu theme. 
That simple.

### Requirements
*  [Hakchi CE v3.5.0 >=](https://github.com/TeamShinkansen/hakchi2/releases/latest)
*  [Options Menu v.1.3.0](https://github.com/CompCom/OptionsMenu/releases/tag/1.3.0)

### Notes

**MAX 60 Themes** more will lead to booting issues + **C8**
Not compatible with custom on theme custom fonts, if you want to use custom fonts use DTM hmod. 

Enjoy it as much as i did making it.
